## Types of Controllers

1. Replication Controllers:
Helps run multiple instances of a single pod in a kubernetes cluster, thus creating High Availability.
it ensures that the specified number of pods are running at all times.
Helps with Load Balancing and Scaling

2. Replica Set:
Same as above, but this is the newer way of replication. 
A replicaset has a selector item in its file, this helps it to manage pods that are not created by the replica set


## IMPORTANCE OF LABELS AND SELECTORS
 Labels help ReplicatSets to filter and know what pods to monitor

## HOW to scale up the replicaSet
1. update the yml file and increase replica to desired number
2. run the command "kubectl replace -f {filename.yml}"
3. Another way to do this is to run "kubectl scale --replicas=X -f {filename.yml}


### REPLICATIONCONTROLLER

apiVersion: v1
kind: ReplicationController
metadata: 
    name: myapp-replication
    labels:
        app: myapp
        type: front-end
spec:
    template:
        metadata: 
            name: myapp-replication
            labels:
                app: myapp
                type: front-end
        spec:
            containers:
            - name: nginx-container
              image: nginx
    replicas: 3


#### REPLICASET

apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: ReplicaSet
metadata: 
    name: myapp-replication
    labels:
        app: myapp
        type: front-end
spec:
    template:
        metadata: 
            name: myapp-replication
            labels:
                app: myapp
                type: front-end
        spec:
            containers:
            - name: nginx-container
              image: nginx
    replicas: 3
    selector: 
        matchLabels:
            type: front-end

3. Deployment: 
This is best for a production environment.
Helps with rolling updates
Roll backs
Undo changes, pause and redo changes.

###
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata: 
    name: myapp-deployment
    namespace: default
    labels:
        app: myapp
        type: front-end
spec:
    replicas: 3
    template:
        metadata:
            name: myapp-deployment
            labels:
                app: myapp
                type: front-end
        spec:
            container:
            - name: nginx-container
              image: nginx
    selector:
        matchLabels:
            type: front-end


4. Services
services enable lose coupling between microservices in our applications
enable frontend application to be made available to end consumers
helps communication between frontend and backend applications
helps in communication to external data sources.

### Types Services
    a. NodePort: Range (30000 - 32767)
    b. ClusterIP
    c. LoadBalancer ( for selected Platform i.e cloud platforms(aws,gcp and azure etc))

## Example ( NodePort)/(LoadBalancer)
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
    name: myapp-service
spec:
    type: NodePort
    ports:
      - targetPort: 80
        port: 80
        nodePort: 30008
    selector:
        app: myapp
        type: front-end

## Example ( ClusterIP)
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
    name: back-end
spec:
    type: ClusterIP
    ports:
        - targetPort: 80
        port: 80
    selector:
        app: myapp
        type: back-end


## LimitRange CPU and Memory

apiVersion: v1
kind: LimitRange
metadata:
    name: limit range cpu
spec:
    limits:
        - default:
            cpu: 500m
          defaultRequest:
            cpu: 500m
          max:
            cpu: 500m
          min:
            cpu: 500m


## Resource Quota is object created on the namespce level

apiVersion: v1
kind: ResourceQuota
metadata:
    name: my resource quota
spec:
    hard:
        requests.cpu: 4
        requests.memory: 4Gi
        limits.cpu: 10
        limits.memory: 4Gi
