helm unistall nginx

helm get notes {chart_name} ## to display the help message that Helm outputs at the end of a deployment
helm get values {chart_name}
helm get values {chart_name} --all

## good place to start troubleshooting 
helm get manifest {chart_name} ### This shows you the deployment file used in creating the cluster

## helm status during deployments
pending-install   THe manifest are ready but they werent sent to K8s yet
deployed          The manifest were sent to k8s and they were accepted
pending-upgrade   The upgrade are ready but they werent sent to K8s yet

helm history {chart_name}
helm rollback {chart_name} {revision_no}

helm uninstall (chart_name) --keep-history

### Tips for installation/Upgrade of Helm
1. Always autogenerate the release name.
helm install {repo_name} --genetate-name
helm install bitnami/nginx --generate-name

2. auto-generate namespace
helm install nginx -n apps bitnami/nginx --create-namespace

3. Install the release or UPgrade it if it exist. (Using the --install flag)
helm upgrade --install nginx05 bitnami/nginx

4. Verify that the application is running. ( Using the --wait flag with --timeout flag)
helm upgrade nginx01 --set image.registry=foobar bitname/nginx --wait (waits for 5mins by default)
helm upgrade nginx01 --set image.registry=foobar bitname/nginx --wait --timeout 10s
